HTML DOCUMENT STRUCTURE


HTML Documents:
➢ All HTML documents must start with a document type declaration: <!DOCTYPE html>.
➢ The HTML document itself begins with <html> and ends with </html>.
➢ The HTML tag has two children one is Head and another one is Body.
• Head tag is used for including all external dependencies into our html file.
• Body tag is used to display website in the web browser.
• The visible part of the HTML document is in between <body> and </body>.


Basic HTML Structure:
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang=”en”>
    <head>
        < meta charset=”UTF-8” >
        < meta http-equiv=”X-UA-Compatible” content=”IE=edge” >
        < meta name=”viewport” content=”width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0” >
        < title > Document < /title >
    < /head >

    < body >
    |
    < /body >
< /html >

Example:
< !DOCTYPE html >
< html >
    < body >
    < h1 >My first heading < /h1>
    < p > My first paragraph. < /p >
    < /body >
< /html >



The < !DOCTYPE > Declaration
• The < !DOCTYPE > declaration represents the document type, and helps browsers to display web pages correctly.
• It must only appear once, at the top of the page (before any HTML tags).
• The < !DOCTYPE > declaration is not case sensitive.
• The < !DOCTYPE > declaration for HTML% is:
< !DOCTYPE html >


HTML Headings
• HTML headings are defined with the <h1> to <h6> tags.
    ➢ <h1> defines the most important heading.
    ➢ <h6> defines the least important heading.

Example:
<h1> This is heading 1 </h1>
<h2> This is heading 2 </h2>
<h3> This is heading 3 </h3>

Example:
<p> This is a paragraph. </p>
<p> This is another paragraph. </p>
